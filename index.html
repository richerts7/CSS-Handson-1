         <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
         <ol class="a">
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets </li> <br>
            <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed< on screen, paper, or in other media</li> <br>
            <li> <b><span style="text-decoration:line-through" ;> Css is not necessary</span> <span class="yel"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li> <br>
            <li> <span style="text-decoration:underline; font-style: italic;"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files </span> </li> 
        
        </ol> 
        
        <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
          <ul class="a">
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements,</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element link to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="yel">  in this 
                tutorial we will use inline  and internal styles,</span> because this is easier  to demonstrate, and easier
                for you to try yourself.</li>

       </ul>

       <p>When comparing  CSS class and Id, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
        ID,on other hand,applies  a style  to one  unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL
        to directly to  an element  and it's  used by JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        In CSS,selectors are used to  target a specific element or range  of element on a web page. Once  an element  has been
        targeted, a style or set of  styles  can be applied  to the  element. 
    </p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are Class and ID. Both are used to target element
        to which a style should be applied.
